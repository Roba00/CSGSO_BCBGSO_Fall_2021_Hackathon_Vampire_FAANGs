# AIWriter
AIWriter is a web app that takes an input prompt (a couple sentences), and generates an essay using that initial prompt. To do this, AIWriter uses the GPT-2 algorithm from OpenAI. GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset. OpenAI created a new dataset which emphasizes diversity of content, by scraping content from the Internet. In order to preserve document quality, they used only pages which have been curated/filtered by humansâ€”specifically. They also used outbound links from Reddit which received at least 3 karma.
